"""Finite-difference stencils: offsets and coefficients, from integers alone.

The lowest layer of the gradient stack. Nothing here touches an array: a
stencil depends only on the derivative order, the accuracy order and the
method, so it is computed once on the host (and cached) and the array
primitives in `geoops.geom._src.array` apply it by slicing on any backend.

The rules are finitediffx's, so the two give the same numbers:

- a *forward* stencil of accuracy :math:`p` for derivative :math:`n` uses
  offsets :math:`0, 1, \\dots, n + p - 1`;
- a *backward* stencil mirrors it, :math:`-(n + p - 1), \\dots, 0`;
- a *central* stencil uses accuracy :math:`p + 1` (so ``accuracy=1`` is the
  second-order three-point stencil, as in ``numpy.gradient``):
  :math:`-\\lfloor (n + p) / 2 \\rfloor, \\dots, \\lfloor (n + p) / 2 \\rfloor`.

The coefficients :math:`c_k` of offsets :math:`s_k` solve the Taylor
conditions :math:`\\sum_k c_k s_k^m = n!\\,\\delta_{mn}` for
:math:`m = 0, \\dots, K - 1`.

Example:
    >>> difference_offsets(derivative=1, accuracy=1, method="central")
    (-1, 0, 1)
    >>> difference_coeffs((-1, 0, 1), derivative=1)
    (-0.5, 0.0, 0.5)
